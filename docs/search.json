    "section": "",
    "text": "We study the effects of crime and agglomeration on urban amenity using data for 134 locations in New Zealand and report three key findings. First, the negative effects of crime operate mostly via rents, with elasticities that range from −0.15 to −0.44. Accounting for endogeneity leads to larger elasticities in some specifications, possibly due to sorting effects. Second, crime has negative effects on the value of urban amenities, with elasticities that range from approximately −0.03 to −0.06 for firms and −0.02 to −0.09 for workers. Using reduced-form models, we show that these effects imply an elasticity of population with respect to crime of −0.04 to −0.10. Third, controlling for crime causes estimates of agglomeration economies to increase by approximately 0.01–0.02 points, on average. Our findings confirm that crime is an important urban congestion cost that erodes productivity and well-being."

    "text": "The effect of crime on agglomeration economies in consumption\nAn important finding of our paper is that controlling for crime causes our estimates of agglomeration economies in production and consumption, \\(E_d^y\\) and \\(E_d^u\\), to increase on average by 0.011 and 0.021 points, respectively. The magnitude of this increase is similar to that reported in (cf. Table 2 Donovan et al. 2022) when controlling for commuting costs, which implies that the negative effects of crime on agglomeration economies may be of a similar order of magnitude to those for road congestion—at least in the New Zealand context. Although the differences in our estimates of average agglomeration economies when controlling for crime are economically significant, they are not statistically significant. Nonetheless, we can draw on other evidence to confirm the effect of crime on agglomeration economies. The figure below illustrates this.\n\n\n\nLeft panel: Histogram of location-specific estimates of agglomeration economies in consumption, \\(E^u_{d,i}\\), from Donovan et al. (2022) where the dashed vertical line denotes the mean. Right panel: \\(E^u_{d,i}\\) (vertical axis) versus total victimisations, \\(\\ln V_i\\) (horizontal axis), where the vertical and horizontal lines denote 95% credibility intervals and the dashed vertical line denotes the population-weighted mean of \\(\\ln V_i\\)."

Compared to the flows of trade, capital and knowledge, we observe that contemporaneous complex institutional differences, historical backgrounds, and individuals’ diverse socio-demographic characteristics make the migrant workers’ choice of destination arguably much more uncontrollable. This study shows that migration is intertwined with culture, networks and language in a complex way, (i) by reviewing related studies on the barriers of culture, networks and language in international labor mobility, and (ii) by exploring missing gaps and prospective avenues for research. Nowadays, the migration pressure on Europe and the United states has created substantial challenges, leading to an urgent need to address the economic assimilation and social integration of migrants. Against this background, we emphasize that these non-economic factors have played an increasingly critical role in shaping international migration and its future socio-economic consequences for destination countries."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For educational purposes we teach in the second year’s course regional and urban economics a simplified version of Krugman’s model in his paper titled Increasing Returns and Economic Geography. The model we have adopted goes as follows:\nWe consider a simplified economy with two regions and 1 (million) workers ( \\(L=1\\) ) in total. Region 1 is inhabited by 100,000 farmers (bound to their land so immobile), while in Region 2 there are 200,000 farmers. Note that in the notation of Krugman this boils down to \\(\\pi_1 = 0.1\\) and \\(\\pi_2 = 0.2\\). All other workers work in manufacturing. Assume now that there is a representative firm that has to choose if and in which region if would settle or that it would settle in both regions by having two branches (one in each region). The fixed costs to establish a firm (or branch) is 0.15. The transportcosts to move goods between region 1 and 2 are equal to 1 and each worker consumer consumes exactly one unit of the final product.\nIt is now up to the student to determine the equilibria in this economy (whether stable or unstable) and identify the trade-off for the firm. Doing this the most insightful and simple way is draw the so-called PP-line and the MM-line. Using the Tikz package within Latex simplifies this enormously.

    "text": "For educational purposes we teach in the second year’s course regional and urban economics a simplified version of Krugman’s model in his paper titled Increasing Returns and Economic Geography. The model we have adopted goes as follows:\nWe consider a simplified economy with two regions and 1 (million) workers ( \\(L=1\\) ) in total. Region 1 is inhabited by 100,000 farmers (bound to their land so immobile), while in Region 2 there are 200,000 farmers. Note that in the notation of Krugman this boils down to \\(\\pi_1 = 0.1\\) and \\(\\pi_2 = 0.2\\). All other workers work in manufacturing. Assume now that there is a representative firm that has to choose if and in which region if would settle or that it would settle in both regions by having two branches (one in each region). The fixed costs to establish a firm (or branch) is 0.15. The transportcosts to move goods between region 1 and 2 are equal to 1 and each worker consumer consumes exactly one unit of the final product.\nIt is now up to the student to determine the equilibria in this economy (whether stable or unstable) and identify the trade-off for the firm. Doing this the most insightful and simple way is draw the so-called PP-line and the MM-line. Using the Tikz package within Latex simplifies this enormously.
