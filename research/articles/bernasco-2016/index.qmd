## Abstract

Using data on the age, sex, ethnicity, and criminal involvement
of more than 14 million residents of all ages residing in approximately
4,000 Dutch neighborhoods, we test if an individualâ€™s criminal involvement
is affected by the proportion of criminals living in his or her residential
neighborhood. We develop a binomial discrete choice model for criminal
involvement and estimate it on individual data. We control for both the
endogeneity that may be related to unobserved neighborhood characteristics
and for sorting behavior. We find significant social interaction effects, but
our findings do not imply multiple equilibria or large multiplier effects

## Illustration

We use a sorting model to map propensity of crime to expected crime propensity yielding multiple equilibria (see below).
