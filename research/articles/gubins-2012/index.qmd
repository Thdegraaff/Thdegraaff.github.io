## Abstract

This paper models strategic interactions between a road supplier, a provider of traffic information, and road users, with stochastic travel times. Using a game-theoretical analysis of
suppliersâ€™ pricing strategies, we assess the social welfare effects of traffic information
under various ownership regimes. The results show that the distortive welfare effect of
monopolistic information pricing appears relatively small. Collusion of the road operator
and information provider yields higher social welfare than independent pricing by two
firms. The intuition behind this result resembles that behind the welfare effects of double
marginalization, but is not exactly the same, as traffic information is not strictly complementary to road use.
